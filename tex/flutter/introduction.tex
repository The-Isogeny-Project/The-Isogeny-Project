The field of isogeny-based cryptography is rapidly expanding since the 2020s.
To keep up with developments in isogeny-based cryptography, we need a strong understanding
of the basics, and a gentle introduction to advanced topics. Unfortunately, there is no
unified place yet, where anyone can go to learn these topics, nor is there unified notation
or sometimes even definitions between authors and works.

This open-source text book aims to fill that gap by providing introductionary materials
to all topics in isogeny-based cryptography. We strongly focus on intuition and examples to
grasp these materials, to ensure that we turn mathematical insight into concrete cryptographic
applications. 

We strive to describe every aspect of isogeny-based cryptography, with ample references to all
related work that introduced or expanded on these concepts. It will be impossible to keep up
with the current progress in isogeny-based cryptography; whenever we have not yet adequately
described a topic, we simply list the literature to provide a starting point for the reader.
